## 🔐 Security Considerations

* Passwords should be hashed before storing in DB.
* Input validations applied for forms (JSP + Servlet side).
* Sessions are validated to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## ✨ Future Enhancements

* ✅ Email/SMS notifications for transactions.
* ✅ Two-factor authentication for login.
* ✅ Role-based access for staff vs admin.
* ✅ Export passbook as PDF/Excel.

👉 This README has all sections: **intro, features, tech stack, setup guide, project structure, screenshots, security, future scope, contributing, license**.  

Do you want me to also prepare a **`schema.sql`** file (with all table creation queries like `customers`, `accounts`, `transactions`, etc.) so you can put it in your `database/` folder and link it in the README?
